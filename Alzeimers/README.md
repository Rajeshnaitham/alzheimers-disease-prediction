# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the presence of Alzheimer's disease using supervised machine learning techniques. It uses a dataset containing clinical and demographic data of patients.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Alzheimer_Prediction_Model.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with all steps: data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `alzheimers_disease_data.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score
- Classification Report

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- XGBoost

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `Alzheimer_Prediction_Model.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install dependencies (if needed).
3. Run all cells step by step to see the prediction pipeline.
